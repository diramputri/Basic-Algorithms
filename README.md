# Fetch-The-Breed
Have you ever came across a good boy (or girl) and wondered what kind of breed(s) he/she is? The classifier is inspired by my PI's mixed breed rescue dog Butterscotch- we still have no idea what breeds she is, and I want to use this project to find out. This project is my first step in larger data science endeavors, and it may help other motivated novices!
